# Valentine GitHub Pages Site 💖 (v4 - BIG random photos)

## Add your photos
Put your pics in `assets/` and update the list in `index.html`:

```js
const PHOTOS = [
  "assets/pic1.jpg",
  "assets/pic2.jpg",
  "assets/pic3.jpg",
  "assets/pic4.jpg"
];
```

GitHub Pages is **case-sensitive**. Filenames must match exactly.

## Add music
Put your mp3 here (if you have rights):
- `assets/opriya.mp3`

## What changed vs v3
- Photos are now **big polaroids** randomly placed around the screen.
- They avoid the center card area.
- “No” button is confined to the button area (won’t cover photos).
